# CIFAR-10 Classification with the Matlab Deep Learning Toolbox
This is a matlab implementation of a tutorial in pytorch in the link below:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html

The classification problem is implemented using the MATLAB deep learning toolbox. This toolbox provides users with visual design and training frameworks that simplify the process of using deep neural networks and minimize the required amount of coding. 
### Designing the Network Architecture
The deep learning toolbox offers a visual neural network design environment that can be launched by typing `deepNetworkDesigner` in the command window.
Depending on the type of network, the user can choose between different layer types, activation functions, and loss functions. The architecture can be assembled by drag&dropping the desired layers in the environment and connecting them together. Here we use the network structure used in the original tutorial. A view of the deep network designer environment is shown in Figure 7.
